# GreenLight

This is an android project by team GreenLight.  We aim to tackle recycling problem in the City of Buffalo.
Understanding that recycling is a difficult problem to solve, we use technology to tackle the problem.

# We have included our android application which named GreenLight.apk 

Our recycle containers have weight pucks which can notify sanitation department on which containers are full and reduce the number of location
that the garbage trucks have to collect each route.
Using our implementation can reduce cost and labor and improve efficiency.
